            <p>In Nuremberg, where the Audi charging hub has been operating since December 2021, more than half of users regularly charge their cars at the charging station. Audi registers an average of 24 charges at around 800 kWh per day in Nuremberg. On top of that, an average of 35 customers visit the approximately 200-square-meter lounge every day, which includes a 40-square-meter terrace over the charging cubes. Audi customers are increasingly using the app to reserve a charging spot for their electric car. The lounge services are frequently taken advantage of as well. Offerings like a changing station for micro-mobility batteries – for instance, for electric scooters – and a delivery service for groceries are also actively used. “The numbers and the positive customer feedback show that our concept of offering a flexible, premium fast-charging infrastructure in urban areas is panning out,” said Ralph Hollmig, the project leader for the Audi charging hub.</p>
            <p>Power cubes serve as energy storage in Nuremberg, as they will at all future Audi charging hub locations. These flexible container cubes can be built up and dismantled on short notice, and each unit offers two fast-charging points. Second-life batteries – that is, used lithium-ion batteries from former Audi test vehicles – serve as energy storage and provide electricity. The Nuremberg location only needs a 200-kW connection to the low-voltage grid to continually fill the storage modules thanks to its 2.45 MWh buffer storage. Audi can consequently offer sustainable fast-charging even in places where the electricity grid isn’t sufficient to operate six HPC charging points at up to 320 kW. Solar panels on the roof provide up to 30 kW of additional green energy in Nuremberg. This is enough to charge up to six electric cars simultaneously.

            </p>
            <p>Audi’s plan is to have more than 20 fully electric models in its portfolio by 2025. By as early as 2026, the only new models the brand with the four rings releases on the market will be fully electric. The company has made a clear commitment to electromobility in terms of investment planning as well. For instance, in the years 2022 to 2026, Audi intends to invest around 18 billion euros in electrification and hybridization, based on its planning round adopted at the end of 2021. With overall investments of around 37 billion euros, nearly half of the outlays will go to these future-oriented topics.</p>
